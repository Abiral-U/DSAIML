## Data Science Assignments

### Overview
These assignments cover statistical analyses, probability computations, hypothesis testing, and data visualization, using Python. The objective is to apply data science principles to solve problems and interpret results meaningfully.

### Topics Covered
1. **SAT Exam Analysis**:
   - Probability computations to evaluate the exam's complexity.
   - Percentile calculations for cutoff marks.
   - Visualization of SAT score distributions.

2. **Normal Distribution Comparisons**:
   - SAT vs. ACT score distributions.
   - Standardization and Z-score comparison for highest raw scores.

3. **Binomial Distribution**:
   - Probability calculations for specific outcomes (e.g., museum visitors buying souvenirs).

4. **Statistical Hypothesis Testing**:
   - One-sample and two-sample t-tests.
   - ANOVA for mean comparisons among groups.

## Machine Learning Assignment: Predicting Labor Earnings (1978)

### Overview
This project focuses on predicting labor earnings for 1978 using **multiple linear regression**. The analysis involves understanding economic variables, checking assumptions for regression, and building a predictive model.

### Problem Statement
*"The Labor Problem"* examines challenges faced by wage-earners and employers due to economic shifts. The dataset provided includes individual demographic and earnings data from 1974 and 1975, with the goal of predicting 1978 earnings.

### Dataset Description
The dataset, **TheLaborProblem.csv**, includes:
- **Age**, **Education**, **Race**, **Marital Status**, and other demographics.
- Historical earnings from 1974 and 1975.
- Target variable: **Earnings_1978**.

### Solution Approach
1. Data preprocessing: Handling categorical variables and splitting the data.
2. Model development: Fitting a multiple linear regression model.
3. Assumption validation: Checking linearity, multicollinearity, homoscedasticity, and residual normality.
4. Model evaluation: Using RMSE and other metrics.

## Key Results

### Data Science Assignments
- Probability of scoring less than 800 or above 1300 on SAT.
- Cutoff scores for 90th percentile and top 5%.
- Statistical tests verifying differences in means and proportions.

### Machine Learning Assignment
- Predictive model for 1978 earnings with RMSE as a performance metric.
- Validation of regression assumptions (e.g., VIF for multicollinearity).
